1. Create a Scheduler object: This is the core engine that determines scheduling behavior, due dates, stability updates, etc.
2. Create a Card object and add it to the database: When a user creates a new card, you instantiate a Card, which starts in the Learning state. (can postgres save card as a python dict?)
3. User studies the card and selects a rating: user gives a rating from the frontend like easy, good, hard or again. (but, how do i determine which card to display? there will be many cards to review right?)
4. Pass the card, rating, and timestamp to the scheduler: The scheduler will update:
    card.state: Learning, Review, or Relearning
    card.step: Current step in learning/relearning
    card.stability and card.difficulty: Memory model parameters
    card.due: 📅 next due time
    card.last_review: ⏰ When the review happened
5. Store the updated card (and optionally review log) back to the DB

important info about when to show a card:
show only if card.due <= now.
FSRS (like Anki) breaks learning into steps spaced out by time:
    Learning: e.g. first step → 10 min later → next step
    Relearning: after lapse, similar to Learning
    Review: long-term scheduled reviews (days/months)
If you show a card just because it's in Learning state, but it’s not due yet (i.e., the 10-minute wait isn’t over), you're going too early.

use jsonb in postgresql 

if i take time elapsed into account, but the user is in the page forgets to answer and comes back a lot later. will this significantly affect reviewing?


from the backend, get all learning or relearning state cards from the backend that is having due date less than current time and sorted by due date
Just keep a mental bookmark: if filtering, sorting, or session logic gets slow or messy later, split the core fields into columns.

"Due" means the card is ready to be reviewed at or after that time, not before.

i want to get cards that is in learning or relearning state AND their due are within current time.
i also want to get cards that is in review state AND their due are within current time. (because i dont want to miss the review cards if their due dates falls below current time right?)
then, i want to order the cards by their states. the learning cards should be first, then relearning cards, the review cards. then, i also want to order them by their due times.

give diff bg to tree list when deleting

allow user to select whether they want to renew scheduler when updating card


for now, i want to build this project to see how it bundles for production. i want the user to be able to download the files and run the application. however, i dont want them to see my code. the frontend is react js. i run it using 'npm run dev'. the backend is fastapi python. i run it using
